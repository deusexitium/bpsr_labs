- Repo root: D:\projects\bpsr-packet-sniffing-study
- Remote URL: https://github.com/JordieB/bpsr-packet-sniffing-study.git

## Bundle Checks
- Bundle present: **True**
- Descriptor present (schema/descriptor_blueprotobuf.pb): **False**
- Prost sources present (source/rust/blueprotobuf_package.rs): **True**
- Opcode mapping present (source/rust/opcodes.rs): **True**
- Capture present (refs/s2c_training_dummy_full.bin): **True**

## Status
**READY for Codex handoff**

## Notes
- Codex must be able to either use an existing descriptor or reconstruct one from prost sources.
- If the descriptor is missing, ensure both lueprotobuf_package.rs and opcodes.rs are present in the bundle.
- Trade Center/Exchange is intentionally out of scope for this handoff.
